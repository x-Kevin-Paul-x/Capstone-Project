# Phase 1 Results: Secure Boot Prototype

## Objective
Ensure firmware and bootloader integrity using a quantum-resistant signature scheme.

## Key Results
- **PQC Algorithm Selected:** CRYSTALS-Dilithium2 has been selected and documented as the signature scheme for firmware signing.
- **Firmware Signing Prototype Implemented:** A command-line tool for signing and verifying firmware binaries using Dilithium2 is complete and tested.
- **End-to-End Local Verification:** The tool can successfully generate keypairs, sign the `minimal_firmware.bin`, and verify the signature.
- **Documentation Updated:** All relevant planning documents, ADRs, and decision logs have been updated to reflect the completion of the prototype.

## Next Steps
- **Bootloader Integration:** Integrate the PQC verification logic into the target bootloader.
- **CI/CD Automation:** A new GitHub Actions workflow has been created to automate the firmware signing process. This workflow needs to be tested and refined.
- **HIL Testing:** Develop and execute Hardware-in-the-Loop tests to validate the secure boot process on target hardware.
