# ADR 0001 â€” Kyber & Dilithium for KEM and Signatures
+
+Status: Accepted
+
+Context
+- The project requires PQC primitives for both key exchange (KEM) and digital signatures for firmware and message authentication.
+- NIST has selected candidates (Kyber family for KEMs and CRYSTALS-Dilithium for signatures) offering a balance of performance and security.
+
+Decision
+- Adopt Kyber (KEM) and Dilithium (signatures) using pyca/cryptography library, which wraps the official reference implementations. We will use NIST level 2 for initial prototyping.
+
+Consequences
+- Pros: Good performance, relatively small public keys and ciphertexts compared to other PQC candidates; robust reference implementations.
+- Cons: Larger sizes than classical ECC; careful profiling required for constrained devices.
+
+-- End ADR 0001
