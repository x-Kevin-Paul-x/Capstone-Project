# Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
This document defines an actionable implementation plan to add a post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) layer to a robotic system, covering secure boot, secure communications, middleware message integrity, and privacy-preserving analytics. Each section includes objectives, concrete actions, deliverables, acceptance criteria, testing/benchmark suggestions, timeline estimates, and risks/mitigations.

## Scope and Assumptions
- Target devices: heterogeneous robotic platforms and edge devices (microcontrollers, SBCs) used in the project.
- Goal: integrate PQC primitives (signatures + KEMs) where they matter most: firmware/boot, communications, middleware, and analytics.
- Assumes access to development toolchains, firmware signing infrastructure, and ability to modify bootloaders and middleware (e.g., ROS/ROS2).
- Assumes available compute resources for prototyping (workstation or cloud VMs) and ability to install benchmark tooling.

## High-level Roadmap (milestones)
1. Prototype PQC firmware signing and boot verification (Secure Boot).
2. Prototype hybrid TLS/KEM channel between robot and cloud (Secure Communication).
3. Integrate message-level signing and key management into middleware (Middleware Security).
4. Evaluate privacy analytics options and prototype FHE for a constrained analytics workload (Privacy Analytics).
5. System-level integration, benchmarking, and final acceptance tests.

## Step 1 — Secure Boot
Objective: Ensure firmware/bootloader integrity using a quantum-resistant signature scheme.

Actions (detailed):
- Select PQC signature candidate(s): prefer NIST-selected signature algorithms (e.g., Dilithium family). Record version, expected signature size, public-key size, and estimated verification cost.
- Identify secure storage mechanism for private keys: secure element, TPM 2.0, or MCU hardware crypto module. Where hardware secure elements are unavailable, plan for sealed software-keystore + supply-chain protections.
- Add signing to CI build pipelines: extend build scripts to produce signed artifacts and generate reproducible signing metadata (signature, signer ID, build hash, timestamp).
- Modify bootloader: implement public-key verification path for signed firmware and a secure fail-safe (recovery mode) when verification fails.

Deliverables:
- Prototype that signs a minimal firmware image and verifies it in the bootloader.
- CI job that produces signed firmware artifacts.

Acceptance criteria:
- Bootloader rejects tampered firmware images.
- Boot time impact < X% (measure and set threshold in profiling step).

Testing / Validation:
- Unit tests for signing/verification routines using PQC reference implementations (PQC library or PQClean bindings).
- Hardware-in-the-loop test: deploy signed firmware to test device and validate boot behavior when signature is altered.

Risks & Mitigations:
- Risk: large signature sizes increase storage/transmission overhead. Mitigation: test multiple parameter sets and choose smallest acceptable signature size.
- Risk: secure element not available on legacy hardware. Mitigation: layered defense — sealed software keystore + secure supply-chain practices.

## Step 2 — Secure Communication
Objective: Establish a quantum-resistant secure channel between robot and cloud/middleware with minimal operational disruption.

Actions (detailed):
- Select PQC KEM candidate(s) (e.g., Kyber-family) and a hybrid approach combining classical ECDH + PQC KEM for key exchange to provide immediate defense-in-depth.
- Implement hybrid TLS 1.3: either by configuring OpenSSL/libtls with PQC support (via liboqs or vendor patches) or by wrapping an application-level hybrid KEM + symmetric channel.
- Integrate with middleware transport: for ROS2, update DDS/TLS plugin or secure transport layer to use the hybrid handshake.
- Benchmark latency, handshake time, and steady-state throughput across representative links (onboard bus, Wi-Fi, LTE). Use realistic message sizes and rates.

Deliverables:
- Working hybrid TLS prototype between a robot node and cloud service.
- Benchmark report with measured handshake times, CPU/memory usage, and throughput.

Acceptance criteria:
- Handshake completes reliably under expected network conditions.
- Incremental latency introduced is within real-time constraints (define numeric thresholds per robot use-case).

Testing / Validation:
- Automated integration tests establishing many concurrent secure sessions while measuring latency and resource usage.
- Regression tests comparing classical and hybrid handshake latencies.

Risks & Mitigations:
- Risk: increased handshake time may impact real-time operation. Mitigation: session resumption, pre-shared keys for constrained links, or selective hybridization only for session establishment.

## Step 3 — Middleware Security & Edge Authentication
Objective: Ensure authenticity and integrity of inter-node messages across the robot and cloud.

Actions (detailed):
- Message-level signing: evaluate costs of signing every message vs. signing batches or channels. Choose appropriate PQC signature parameters optimized for verification speed.
- Key management: design a centralized key management service (KMS) that supports provisioning, rotation, and revocation of PQC keys. Integrate audit logging and secure transport for key distribution.
- Edge profiling: measure CPU, RAM, and flash usage on each device class to determine feasibility of per-message signatures.

Deliverables:
- Middleware integration showing signed messages and verification path.
- KMS prototype or integration plan with an existing KMS (describe API and security model).

Acceptance criteria:
- Successfully detect and reject tampered messages in end-to-end tests.
- Key rotation can be performed without full system downtime.

Testing / Validation:
- Fuzz and adversarial tests that attempt to inject malformed or replayed messages.
- Performance tests for message signing/verification at target message rates.

Risks & Mitigations:
- Risk: signing every message is too expensive. Mitigation: packet-level MACs derived from a signed session key, or selective signing of critical messages.

---

## Step 4 — Privacy Analytics
Objective: Allow analytics on sensitive data without exposing plaintext while considering practicality for constrained environments.

Actions (detailed):
- Identify analytics workloads that must be privacy-preserving (e.g., user telemetry, imagery). Prioritize a small, high-value workload to prototype.
- Evaluate feasible techniques: FHE, secure multi-party computation (MPC), and differential privacy. FHE provides strongest guarantees but is the most computationally expensive.
- Prototype with a lightweight FHE library on server-side analytics for a small pipeline and measure end-to-end latency and cost.

Deliverables:
- Prototype pipeline demonstrating one encrypted computation completed over FHE or a hybrid approach (FHE for critical ops, DP for aggregated stats).
- Performance/feasibility report.

Acceptance criteria:
- Analytics result correctness verified against plaintext baseline.
- Latency and cost meet the acceptable threshold for the selected workload.

Testing / Validation:
- Compare FHE outputs against plaintext computations for correctness and numerical stability.
- Load tests to show throughput limitations and bottlenecks.

Risks & Mitigations:
- Risk: FHE too slow for production. Mitigation: use FHE only for offline/off-peak analytics, use differential privacy for near-real-time use-cases.

## Cross-cutting Concerns
- Documentation and reproducibility: every prototype must include reproducible build steps and CI integration where possible.
- Metrics and monitoring: instrument components to collect metrics (latency, CPU, memory, handshake success rate) and expose them to an observability stack.
- Compliance and supply-chain: ensure key provisioning and secure element sourcing follow procurement security practices.

## Edge Cases (3–5 important examples)
1. Extremely constrained edge device cannot perform PQC operations within required timing: fallback to session pre-provisioning or delegate heavy ops to a gateway device.
2. Network partitions and intermittent connectivity: ensure key rotation and revocation semantics tolerate delayed updates and that nodes can operate with cached credentials until reconnected.
3. Corrupted firmware image during transport: verify that CI signing metadata and firmware hashes are used by recovery utilities to safely roll back.
4. Compromised key in software-only keystore: plan for rapid revocation, key rotation, and offline re-provisioning flow.

## Timeline & Responsibilities (example - adjust to team availability)
- Sprint 1 (2–3 weeks): Secure Boot prototype, CI signing. Owner: Firmware lead.
- Sprint 2 (2–4 weeks): Hybrid TLS prototype + benchmarks. Owner: Networking lead.
- Sprint 3 (2–4 weeks): Middleware signing + KMS prototype. Owner: Middleware lead.
- Sprint 4 (2–4 weeks): Privacy analytics prototype and evaluation. Owner: Data lead.

## Tests and Validation Plan (brief)
- Unit tests for crypto operations (use test vectors from PQC libs).
- Integration tests installing signed firmware on test hardware.
- Performance benchmarks: handshake time, throughput, CPU/memory usage, end-to-end latency under load.

## Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done
- Each milestone produces a working prototype, benchmark report, and documented integration steps.
- All security-critical code paths have automated unit and integration tests and are reviewed.

## Next Steps (practical)
1. Create tickets for each Sprint with clear acceptance criteria and owners.
2. Select PQC candidate parameter sets and add them to a decision log (pros/cons, sizes, measured costs).
3. Allocate test hardware and CI runners for hardware-in-the-loop testing.
4. Start Secure Boot sprint: sign a minimal firmware image and validate on a test device.

## References & Suggested Libraries
- PQC implementations and testvectors: PQClean, liboqs.
- TLS/PQC integration: OpenSSL + liboqs, QSSL forks, or vendor-supplied PQC-enabled stacks.
- FHE libraries to evaluate: Microsoft SEAL, TFHE, or PALISADE (prototype and measure before committing).
